The magnetic mirror corresponds to  ... <br>

When the magnetic field becomes strong enough, the parallel velocity ($v_\parallel$) of the particle goes to zero, and the perpendicular velocity ($v_\perp$) reaches its maximum value. At this point, the particle is reflected and begins moving in the opposite direction along the  z-axis (parallel to the magnetic field lines).

In a very slowly magnetic field, the magnetic moment $\mu=v^2_\perp/2B$ is conserved, it leaves the relation <br>

$$v^2_\perp \propto 2B$$

So for regions where the magnetic field increases, it also does the perpendicular velocity. But the energy E is also conserved 

$$ E= \frac{1}{2} m ( v^2_\parallel  + v^2_\perp)$$
