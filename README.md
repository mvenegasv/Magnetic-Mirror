The magnetic mirror corresponds to  ... <br>

When the magnetic field becomes strong enough, the parallel velocity ($v_\parallel$) of the particle goes to zero, and the perpendicular velocity ($v_\perp$) reaches its maximum value. At this point, the particle is reflected and begins moving in the opposite direction along the  z-axis (parallel to the magnetic field lines).

In a very slowly magnetic field, the magnetic moment $\mu=v^2_\perp/2B$ is an adiabatic constant, so it leaves the relation <br>

$$v^2_\perp \propto 2B$$

such that for regions where the magnetic field increases, it also does the perpendicular velocity. Additionally, the energy E is also conserved and is purelly kinetic given by 

$$ E= \frac{1}{2} m ( v^2_\parallel  + v^2_\perp)$$

So when $v^2_\perp$ increases, $v^2_\parallel$ must decrease. 
The particle reflects when $v_\parallel=0$, meaning it momentarily stops moving along the z axis. At this point all its kinetic energy is in the perpendicular direction ($v_\perp$ is maximized). Then, the particle reverses its direction of motion along the z-axis.

Regarding to the magnetic momnet, how much slow should be the magnetic field in order to get $\mu$ as an adiabatic constant
